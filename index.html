<h2>Basic Information</h2>

<p>Apple's iOS 18 is Apple's latest and biggest software update ever! It is packed with so many new features like: a customizable control center, Apple Intelligence, new look for app icons, rearrangement of apps and widgets, locking and hiding apps, a controls gallery for the control center and your lock screen, and so much more! Not only is iOS 18 packed with new features, but it also comes with a ton of security enhancements, bug fixes, and so many more enhancements to the OS! You can't just download it to your device right away; you have to make sure your device is supported. iOS 18 is compatible with the iPhone Xr, iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max or newer. If this includes your device, which it lists the supported devices on the back of Apple's iOS 18 page (link is listed at the end), you are good to update to iOS 18! If your device is not supported, unfortunately, you can't update and you have to stay on the current version you're currently on (unless there are security updates). iOS 18 is an update that I recommend to anyone that loves new features to play around with, and is interested in Apple products altogether. For the average user, I still recommend that you update because of security enhancements that iOS 17.6 might not have. Sure, it might have some bugs when you first download the update, but that's part of using all kinds of software. Also, Apple could push another software update out anytime, which is why you should always be on the lookout for new updates and make sure you ALWAYS backup your iPhone! iOS 18 is an update that might be daunting to some people, but I believe that everyone with an iPhone should update to iOS 18.
